                                <h2>63 Rohingyas infected with HIV: Minister</h2>
                                <p>Sangsad Bhaban: Sixty-three of the Rohingya people who have taken shelter in Bangladesh are HIV-infected patients, Health Minister Mohammed Nasim told Parliament on Wednesday.

‘Now there’re 4,662 HIV-infected patients in our country. Of them, 63 are from the Rohingya community,’ he said replying to a tabled starred question from treasury bench MP Shamsul Hoque Chowdhury (Chattogram-12), reports the UNB.

As of October 2017, 5,586 patients were detected with HIV positive and 924 of them have already died, the minister said.

Nasim said the government is now providing services to HIV-infected patients free of cost. The services include HIV test, free medicines and counseling.

Besides, different non-government organisations, national and international agencies provide services to HIV patients, he said.

The minister said the government has a plan to set up HIV Test Centres (HTC) in 23 prioratised districts, provide necessary basic trainings over HIV/AIDS and provide camp-based healthcare facilities.</p>

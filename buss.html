									Prime minister Sheikh HasinaPrime minister Sheikh Hasina on Wednesday told parliament that the outgoing fiscal year (2017-'18) will see a 7.78 per cent GDP growth, reports UNB.

									"...7.78 per cent GDP growth has been projected in the current fiscal year, which is the highest in the country's history," she said.

									The prime minister said this while replying to a tabled question from opposition Jatiya Party MP Fakhrul Imam (Mymensingh-8).

									Sheikh Hasina said the size of the country's GDP was only US$ 72 billion in 2005-'06 fiscal year, which has increased to US$ 274 billion in the 2017-'18 fiscal year.

									The target has been set in the 7th five-year plan to attain an average 7.4 per cent GDP growth annually. The GDP growth will increase to 8 per cent in 2020, she hoped.

									Mentioning her government's various successes, the prime minister said the country's foreign currency reserve rose to US$ 33.41 billion in the 2017-'18 fiscal year from only US$ 3.48 billion in 2006.

									She said the per capita income was only US$ 543 in 2006, which currently stands at US$ 1,752.

									The poverty rate has now decreased to 22 per cent from 41.5 percent in the 2005-'06 fiscal year, Hasina added.

									The prime minister said the export volume was only US$ 10.5 billion in 2006, which now stands at US$ 34.8 billion.

								A man works at a furnace at a steel plant of Dalian Special Steel Co Ltd in Dalian, Liaoning province, China on 20 June. Photo: ReutersProfits at China’s industrial firms rose sharply in May, maintaining the previous month’s sizzling pace despite signs of slowing momentum in the world’s second-largest economy and an intensifying trade spat with the United States.

								Industrial profits rose 21.1 per cent to 607.1 billion yuan ($92.00 billion) in May, according to data published by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Wednesday, compared to 21.9 per cent growth in April.

								For the first five months, industrial firms notched up profits of 2.73 trillion yuan, an increase of 16.5 per cent from a year earlier, versus a 15 per cent increase in the January-April period.

								The earnings jump in May was driven by price gains and lower costs, statistics bureau official He Ping said in a statement accompanying the data.

								China’s industrial firms have benefited from a hot property and infrastructure construction market over the past two years, which helped stimulate demand for building materials from steel bars to copper pipes, glass and cement.

								And while sales have cooled in the face of government restrictions on home purchases, new construction starts rose 20.5 per cent in May and property investment also picked up, suggesting any property slowdown is likely to be relatively modest.

								But activity in other parts of the economy including infrastructure investment and industrial output point to softening growth in the world’s second largest economy.

								While industrial commodity prices have been strong this year, an intensifying trade dispute between Beijing and Washington has rattled China’s commodity markets this month as both sides threatened new import tariffs.

								China also continues to battle high pollution levels, with government-ordered suspension of production for steel, cement, coal-fired power plans and petrochemical makers in recent months adding to the challenge for industrial producers ahead.

								Beijing is trying to walk a tightrope between supporting economic growth and tamping down financial risks, with policymakers freeing up more funds for lending by cutting required reserve levels for banks twice since April.

								Profits at China’s state-owned industrial firms rose 28.7 per cent year-on-year in Jan-May period, quickening from a 26.2 per cent increase in the first four months.

								Chinese industrial firms’ liabilities rose 6.3 per cent on an annual basis as of end-May, according to the stats bureau.

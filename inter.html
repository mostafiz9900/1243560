                                <h2>Xi Jinping meet US defence chief amid tension</h2>
                                <p>Chinese president Xi Jinping told US Defense Secretary James Mattis Wednesday the two countries must sustain the "good momentum" of their military relationship, amid US worries about China's projection of power across the Indo-Pacific.

Mattis, visiting Beijing to take the measure of China's global security ambitions, especially in the South China Sea, told Xi he wants to keep the bilateral military relationship on an even keel and find areas to cooperate.

"I’m here to keep our relationship on the right trajectory, keep it going in the right direction and to share ideas with your military leadership, as well as look at the way ahead," the Pentagon chief told Xi.

There were no references to rising bilateral tensions, in both military and economic relations, in public remarks ahead of their meeting in the Great Hall of the People.

But Mattis blasted China earlier this month over the militarisation of built-up islets it claims in the South China Sea, and president Donald Trump has sparked a trade war with the country.

In consequence, the deterioration of relations was barely below the surface of Xi's and Mattis's diplomatic remarks.

"The Chinese-US relationship is one of the most important bilateral relationships in the world," Xi said.

"Over the recent years this military-to-military relationship has had good momentum... I would like to hope this momentum of the military-to-military relationship would continue."

The two met after Mattis spent a day in meetings with other top Chinese officials, including defence minister Wei Fenghe and politburo member and former ambassador to the United States Yang Jiechi.

Mattis, on his first visit to China, came in search of a "very open and honest dialogue" about the long-term strategic goals of both countries.

Ahead of the visit he acknowledged the tensions but said he believed he could find areas where the two militaries could cooperate, in hopes of building better communications and reducing the chances of conflict.

- Strategic dialogue -
"I think the way to address issues between our two nations is to first establish a transparent strategic dialogue: how do the Chinese see the relationship with us developing, how we see it developing," he said before the visit.

But only weeks beforehand he had accused Xi of reneging on a promise not to place weaponry on contested islands in the South China Sea.

Beijing has installed missile batteries and recently landed long-range bombers on some of the reclaimed outposts.

It argues that the islands are Chinese territory and says it has the right to install military facilities to protect its sovereignty.

Yet the projection of force has challenged the US Navy's decades-old pre-eminence in the region. Mattis, speaking at a security conference in Singapore in early June, said China's actions were aimed at "intimidation and coercion".

Showing US displeasure, the US disinvited the Chinese from an exercise of some two dozen Pacific Rim navies that was beginning this week.

Earlier Wednesday Mattis was greeted at the headquarters of the People's Liberation Army by an honour guard and marching band playing the US and Chinese anthems.

Defence minister Wei called the visit crucial "to increase the strategic trust between our countries".

He said Mattis's words "carry weight in both the military and political circles back in the United States".

Besides hoping to strengthen military ties, Mattis was expected to discuss ways to maintain pressure on North Korea to persuade it to give up its nuclear weapons.

China is Pyongyang's closest ally and Washington sees its cooperation in preserving an economic embargo on North Korea as crucial.

Mattis will continue meeting Chinese officials through Thursday morning, and then fly to Seoul and Tokyo. He will reaffirm the US security commitment to its East Asian allies amid some nervousness about Trump's embrace of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.</p>

                                <p>From boat makers to farmers, US-led tariff war inflicts pain

Peter Truslow, chief executive officer for Bertram, a boat building company, poses near three of his custom made boats Friday, 22 June 2018, in Tampa, Fla Photo : APA Florida boat builder absorbs $4 million in lost business and expects more pain. An Ohio pork producer is losing access to a vital export market and fears the damage will last years. A motorcycle shop near Cologne, Germany, wonders if it even has a future.

A brawl that the United States provoked with its closest trading partners is starting to draw blood. On Friday, the European Union began imposing tariffs on $3.4 billion in American goods - from whiskey and motorcycles to peanuts and cranberries - to retaliate for president Donald Trump's own tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. China, India and Turkey had earlier begun penalising American products in response to the US tariffs on metals.

"We're bleeding pretty bad right now," said Jim Heimerl, a pork producer in Johnstown, Ohio.

Pork producers like Heimerl are already suffering from plunging prices and reduced income since China's move to impose a 25 per cent tariff on American pork in retaliation for Trump's tariffs on imported steel and aluminum.

If the trade rift doesn't worsen, the damage to the overall economy will likely be modest, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. But no one can say that the economic harm will end soon.

On 6 July, the United States is set to slap tariffs on $34 billion in Chinese goods to punish Beijing for forcing American companies to hand over technology in exchange for access to China's market and other brass-knuckled attempts to supplant US technological dominance.

Beijing has vowed to retaliate. And Trump has threatened to punch back again with tariffs that could eventually cover $450 billion in Chinese products - representing nearly 90 per cent of all goods Beijing exports to the United States.

Escalating tariffs would likely raise prices for consumers, inflate costs for companies that rely on imported parts, rattle markets and paralyse business investment as executives wait to see whether the United States can reach a truce with the trading partners it's fighting with.

A full-fledged trade war, economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch warn, risks tipping the US economy into recession.

Heimerl, president of the National Pork Producers Council, noted that American hog farmers depend on China's growing market. The price of hog futures has plunged since the tensions with Beijing started flaring in March. On an annual basis, it means a loss to pork producers of $2.2 billion, according to Iowa State University economist Dermot Hayes.

China is "a big player to us," Heimerl said. "They take a lot of products the US doesn't eat - hearts, lungs, intestines, stomachs and heads, some of the products we don't eat here."

He recalls that it took American farmers years to recover after president Jimmy Carter imposed a grain embargo on the Soviet Union in 1980 and cut off a crucial market.

In the next round of tariffs, the Chinese are preparing retaliatory penalties on American soybeans - an economically vital export of Midwestern farmers, who have been a key source of support for Trump.

The Europeans, too, targeted American products with political calculation - bourbon from Kentucky, the home state of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and motorcycles, which are made in Wisconsin, represented by house speaker Paul Ryan.

Yet the pain of the EU's 25 per cent motorcycle tariffs is being felt across the Atlantic, too. Just ask Andy Mueller, who sells Tennessee-made Boss Hoss motorcycles in Huerth, Germany, near Cologne.

"The tariffs affect done deals," Mueller said. "We bought a couple of motorcycles recently. They were already ordered by customers, and they're on their way now. Now we need to explain that they have to pay a special price" that includes the added cost of the tariff.

"We can sell what we have, but we can't order new units," Mueller said. He fears for the future: "Boss Hoss is done for sure in Europe."

Also in the EU's crosshairs: America's recreational boating industry. It employs 650,000 people in the United States at manufacturers, marinas and dealers.

Ninety-five per cent of the boats sold in the US are American-made. It's no coincidence that the EU slapped US motorboats, sailboats and yachts with 25 per cent tariffs, said Nicole Vasilaros of the National Marine Manufacturers Associations. Canada is also readying a 10 per cent tariff on boats to begin 1 July.

The industry has "become a target for those that are wishing to make a point to this president," Vasilaros said. "It's a real US manufacturing industry. In an era where not a lot is still made here in the US, boats are."

The top boat-building states are Florida, Tennessee, North Carolina, Minnesota, Indiana, Arkansas and Wisconsin. In Orlando, Florida, Regal Marine Industries - which makes everything from 19-foot motorboats to 53-foot yachts priced above $1 million - said it's had $4 million worth of orders canceled or delayed. CEO Duane Kuck estimates that the company, which employs 750 in Orlando and Valdosta, Georgia, will lose $13 million in revenue this year from European and Canadian tariffs.

"It's hitting very hard and very quick," Kuck said.

The EU and Canada accounted for up to 20 per cent of Regal's business. If the tariffs last past 60 days, Kuck estimates that his company would have to cut about 40 jobs, either through attrition or layoffs.

Bertram Yachts in Tampa, Florida, is scrambling to salvage sales. This week, a customer in Monaco called to cancel the purchase of a $4 million, 61-foot yacht, citing the added cost of the tariffs. To save the deal, CEO Peter Truslow plans to offer to make the contract contingent on the tariffs being lifted. Yet it's far from clear when - or whether - that might happen.

"It could be a day, it could be years," Truslow said.

Before the tariffs, Bertram had been growing rapidly, with Europe accounting for perhaps 15 per cent of sales. The company had planned to expand its staff of 90; the tariffs have put any hiring on hold.

"The perception in the public," Truslow said, "is there's a bunch of rich guys hanging out at fancy marinas or something. But 90 per cent of the people that work in the yacht business, they're laying fiberglass and installing hardware. They're hourly, hard-working guys, the same as you'd see in a car manufacturer. Those are the ones that get affected.

"Who's the loser in this? The small yacht companies and the employees</p>

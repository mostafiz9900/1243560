									Prime minister Sheikh HasinaPrime minister Sheikh Hasina on Wednesday told parliament that the outgoing fiscal year (2017-'18) will see a 7.78 per cent GDP growth, reports UNB.

									"...7.78 per cent GDP growth has been projected in the current fiscal year, which is the highest in the country's history," she said.

									The prime minister said this while replying to a tabled question from opposition Jatiya Party MP Fakhrul Imam (Mymensingh-8).

									Sheikh Hasina said the size of the country's GDP was only US$ 72 billion in 2005-'06 fiscal year, which has increased to US$ 274 billion in the 2017-'18 fiscal year.

									The target has been set in the 7th five-year plan to attain an average 7.4 per cent GDP growth annually. The GDP growth will increase to 8 per cent in 2020, she hoped.

									Mentioning her government's various successes, the prime minister said the country's foreign currency reserve rose to US$ 33.41 billion in the 2017-'18 fiscal year from only US$ 3.48 billion in 2006.

									She said the per capita income was only US$ 543 in 2006, which currently stands at US$ 1,752.

									The poverty rate has now decreased to 22 per cent from 41.5 percent in the 2005-'06 fiscal year, Hasina added.

									The prime minister said the export volume was only US$ 10.5 billion in 2006, which now stands at US$ 34.8 billion.

								A man works at a furnace at a steel plant of Dalian Special Steel Co Ltd in Dalian, Liaoning province, China on 20 June. Photo: ReutersProfits at China’s industrial firms rose sharply in May, maintaining the previous month’s sizzling pace despite signs of slowing momentum in the world’s second-largest economy and an intensifying trade spat with the United States.

								Industrial profits rose 21.1 per cent to 607.1 billion yuan ($92.00 billion) in May, according to data published by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Wednesday, compared to 21.9 per cent growth in April.

								For the first five months, industrial firms notched up profits of 2.73 trillion yuan, an increase of 16.5 per cent from a year earlier, versus a 15 per cent increase in the January-April period.

								The earnings jump in May was driven by price gains and lower costs, statistics bureau official He Ping said in a statement accompanying the data.

								China’s industrial firms have benefited from a hot property and infrastructure construction market over the past two years, which helped stimulate demand for building materials from steel bars to copper pipes, glass and cement.

								And while sales have cooled in the face of government restrictions on home purchases, new construction starts rose 20.5 per cent in May and property investment also picked up, suggesting any property slowdown is likely to be relatively modest.

								But activity in other parts of the economy including infrastructure investment and industrial output point to softening growth in the world’s second largest economy.

								While industrial commodity prices have been strong this year, an intensifying trade dispute between Beijing and Washington has rattled China’s commodity markets this month as both sides threatened new import tariffs.

								China also continues to battle high pollution levels, with government-ordered suspension of production for steel, cement, coal-fired power plans and petrochemical makers in recent months adding to the challenge for industrial producers ahead.

								Beijing is trying to walk a tightrope between supporting economic growth and tamping down financial risks, with policymakers freeing up more funds for lending by cutting required reserve levels for banks twice since April.

								Profits at China’s state-owned industrial firms rose 28.7 per cent year-on-year in Jan-May period, quickening from a 26.2 per cent increase in the first four months.

								Chinese industrial firms’ liabilities rose 6.3 per cent on an annual basis as of end-May, according to the stats bureau.

                                <h2>12-yr-old Indian becomes grandmaster</h2>
                                <p>A 12-year-old Indian boy described as "unstoppable" by his proud father has become the world's second youngest chess grandmaster ever.

Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa, the son of a bank employee from the southern city of Chennai, achieved the feat with some aggressive play at an event in northern Italy that ended Sunday.

Praggnanandhaa -- whose 17-year-old big sister Vaishali Rameshbabu is also no slouch at the game, being a two-time youth chess champion -- was aged 12 years, 10 months and 13 days when he won the title.

But this was too old to beat the current record-holder, Sergey Karjakin of Ukraine, who was 12 years and exactly seven months when he made the grade in 2002.

Praggnanandhaa's father said that his son, who practises six hours a day and watches past matches online, was not even four when he first started taking an interest in chess.

However, he said the family could not afford to pay for extra travel and training for both the boy and his sister.

"But the passion in him to play chess was unstoppable, I had to give in and put him in coaching classes. And he has been unstoppable since," the 53-year-old, who has the same name as his son, told Indian media.</p>

                                <h2>Grammys expand nominee field after criticism on diversity</h2>
                                <p>The Grammys will expand the number of nominees in main categories for music’s most prestigious awards as organizers try to counter a backlash over how few women and minorities are winning.

In one of the biggest changes at the Grammys in years, the Recording Academy-which administers the prizes-said Tuesday in a letter to members that next year’s awards will boost the field of hopefuls from five to eight for the top four categories.

The prizes are Album of the Year; Record of the Year, which recognizes overall song; Song of the Year, which honours song writing; and Best New Artist.

Other categories will remain at five nominees. The 2019 Grammys will take place at the Staples Centre in Los Angeles at the start of the year, though an exact date has not yet been announced.

The change echoes the 2009 decision of the Academy Awards to double the number of contenders for the Best Picture Oscar from five to 10 at the most.

But while the film academy was largely trying to find a place at the televised gala for crowd-pleasing blockbusters alongside critically acclaimed fare, the Recording Academy is facing quite a different dilemma.

Criticism has mounted that the Recording Academy’s tastes are consistently old-fashioned, more in line with the older, mostly white male professionals who vote and out of tune with contemporary culture.

Hoping to bring more diversity, the Recording Academy made another key change in time for this year’s awards by switching to online ballots, broadening its pool to itinerant musicians who are not waiting at their mailboxes.

Likely due to the reform, the 2018 Grammys for the first time saw hip-hop dominate the top categories.

But the night’s big winner was ultimately Bruno Mars, the party-loving funk revivalist, rather than politically aware rappers Kendrick Lamar, Jay-Z or Childish Gambino.

And the latest Grammys was strikingly devoid of women, with Lorde the only nominee for Album of the Year and none earning a nod for Record of the Year, at a time that the growing #MeToo movement was raising concern about the gender biases and harassment holding back women.

Backlash from women

Asked after the 28 January awards in New York why more women were not winning, Portnow said that female musicians needed to “step up,” while also speaking of the need for more mentorship.

His remarks generated a furor, with stars including Katy Perry and P!nk taking him to task and a group of women music executives demanding that he quit.

Portnow said on 31 May that he was stepping down next year, meaning that the expansion of Grammy nominations will likely be one of the final decisions under his watch.

In a statement announcing the expansion of nominees, Portnow said that the Recording Academy was seeking to adapt to an “ever-changing industry.”

The expansion “creates more opportunities for a wider range of recognition” and “gives more flexibility to our voters when having to make the often challenging decisions,” said Portnow, a record executive who has led the academy since 2002.

Change on world music

The Recording Academy also announced reform of the Grammy for Best World Music Album, one of the categories that draws the most eye-rolls among aficionados.

Starting next year, a review committee will determine the five nominees out of the top 15 put forward in nominations by the Academy’s 13,000 members.

Despite aiming to represent the whole planet, the World Music category has been dominated by a handful of favorites.

The South African all-male choir Ladysmith Black Mambazo, popularized abroad by Paul Simon’s 1986 “Graceland” album, won this year for the fifth time. Other perennial nominees include pop flamenco veterans Gipsy Kings.

Between 2004 and 2011, the award was split into two categories-one for traditional and one for contemporary world music-before they were merged again.</p>

                                <h2>‘Bollywood Oscars’ honours Sridevi</h2>
                                <p>Bollywood superstar Sridevi Kapoor was honoured for her final role at India’s movie awards in Bangkok, winning best actress at the celebration of dance, music and film just months after her shock death.

Sridevi was considered one of the most influential Bollywood actresses of all time. Her death from accidental drowning in a Dubai hotel room bathtub aged 54 in February left the nation in stunned grief.

“I have mixed emotions today. I miss her every minute and second of my life,” her widower Boney Kapoor said as he collected the gong on her behalf at the Indian Film Academy’s (IIFA) annual awards ceremony.

“I still feel she is around... I want you all to support Janhvi like you supported her mother,” the Bollywood producer said in an emotional speech quoted by Indian media, referring to the eldest of Sridevi’s two daughters who is set to make her Bollywood debut.

With an audience of more than 850 million, the IIFA Awards-dubbed Bollywood’s Oscars by some in the industry-is India’s biggest media event.

It is also one of the world’s most-watched annual entertainment shows, held outside India to demonstrate Bollywood’s global appeal.

Sridevi “was the queen of grace and worthy of every praise”, read a message from the IIFA’s Twitter account.

The ceremony saw India’s biggest stars descend on the Thai capital late Sunday for a riotous evening filled with glamour and stunning dance routines.

But it was given an additional tinge of sadness as best actor went to Irrfan Khan, known internationally for his roles in blockbusters “Life of Pi” and “Slumdog Millionaire”, in his absence.

Earlier this year the Indian actor, who was also in the 2016 film “Inferno” alongside Tom Hanks and is one of Bollywood’s most globally recognised exports, revealed he has a rare tumour and is being treated in London.

                                <h2>Neymar hits back at critics with emotional post after Costa Rica win</h2>
                                <p>Brazil struggled hard to crack the Costa Rican wall named Keylor Navas with goals from Philippe Coutinho and Neymar in the dying moments of the match at the Saint Petersburg Stadium on Friday night (June 22). With a 2-0 win, Brazil stay afloat in the race to reach the last-16 of FIFA World Cup 2018, while Costa Rica bid adieu.

The win was indeed emotional for Brazil who had enjoyed the victory after last three consecutive failed attempts in World Cup history, but more so for Neymar who shrugged off his goal drought. And he answered his critics with an emotional post. After Coutinho’s tap-in from close range seconds into the injury time, Neymar drifted in the curler from Gabriel Jesus five minutes later to double the lead. It was his fifth World Cup goal in seven appearances and he also managed to surpass Brazilian legend Romario to stand third in their all-time list of goalscorers. Like Lionel Messi, pressure and hopes both rested on Neymar’s shoulders. He will remain the central figure for the fans despite them along with critics denouncing him repeatedly after each failure.

‘Not everyone knows what I went through to get here,’ he posted on Twitter and Instagram. ‘Even parrots can talk, but walking the walk... not everyone does it. I cried out of happiness, overcoming, grit and desire to win. ‘Things were never easy in my life, so why would they be now? The dream - no, the OBJECTIVE - is still alive. Congratulations for the performance, guys.’

Coach Tite warned Brazilian fans not to put too much pressure on the 26-year-old, who is playing his fourth game for Brazil after the foot injury in February.

‘The joy, the satisfaction, and the pride of representing the Brazilian national team is a lot,’ Tite told reporters. He has the responsibility, the joy, the pressure and the courage to show it. We each show it in our own way.’’He was three-and-a-half months out (with injury) and he played the full match,’ Tite added.

Nem todos sabem o q passei pra chegar até aqui,falar até papagaio fala, agora fazer...O choro é de alegria, de superação, de garra.
Na minha vida as coisas nunca foram fáceis, não seria agora né! O sonho continua, sonho não, OBJETIVO! 
Parabéns pela partida rapaziada,vcs são FODA pic.twitter.com/dgdtK2zKei

                                <h2>Do or die: Messi needs magic!</h2>
                                <p>Moscow: Lionel Messi, arguably the greatest soccer player in history, has had a miserable World Cup and must turn it around immediately to save Argentina from a humiliating early exit from the tournament.

Messi leads Argentina into a must-win Tuesday game against Nigeria at St. Petersburg Stadium, where the African team would advance out of Group D with a victory.

The South Americans are winless at the World Cup, Messi has yet to score a goal, and a victory against Nigeria won't guarantee a spot in the round of 16. Argentina must win, and get help from Croatia, which has already advanced.

Croatia has no pressure in its match against Iceland, which must win its final Group D game in Rostov-on-Don to advance. If Iceland wins, Argentina is out and Messi's international career might be over, reports the AP.

Messi turned 31 two days before the match, and there's strong speculation he'll retire from the national team if Argentina loses.

‘That will be our main goal, to make it Messi's last World Cup game,’ Nigeria defender Bryan Idowu said. ‘As much as we enjoy watching Messi play, it's against us. There's only one option for us, (which) is that he plays his last game in St. Petersburg.’

Argentina fans have been livid over the performances of the national team in this tournament, with much of the wrath directed at Messi. Although Nigeria coach Gernot Rohr is a fan of the five-time world player of the year, he has no sympathy for Messi's plight Tuesday.

‘Everybody loves him,’ Rohr said. ‘But in football there is no mercy, there is no pity. Everyone wants to win and no one can make any gifts, even if we like him so much.’

Messi, whose 64 career goals for Argentina, missed a penalty in Argentina's opening match, a 1-1 draw with Iceland. He also failed to score in a 3-0 loss to Croatia. It's part of a disappointing international run in which Messi's only medal with Argentina came 10 years ago at the Summer Olympics.

He didn't score in the 1-0 loss to Germany in the World Cup final four years ago, and was on the losing team in the Copa America finals in 2007, 2015 and 2016.

The match will be the fifth meeting between Argentina and Nigeria at the World Cup, and Argentina has won the last four. Messi scored twice when Argentina beat Nigeria 3-2 in the group stage four years ago.

Iceland, meanwhile, is the nation with the smallest population ever to qualify for a World Cup with 350,000 inhabitants. The entire nation has been following the squad, which is known at home as ‘Our Boys.’ The draw against Argentina was an upset, but Iceland then dropped the next game 2-0 to Nigeria.

Iceland beat Croatia in a World Cup qualifier, and now finds its rival in its path again.

‘We know the scenario when we play Croatia, it's going to be a really tough game,’ coach Heimir Hallgrimsson said. ‘We've often said we're like a married couple. We're trying to get divorced, but we always meet up again.’</p>

                                <h2>Neymar hits back at critics with emotional post after Costa Rica win</h2>
                                <p>Brazil struggled hard to crack the Costa Rican wall named Keylor Navas with goals from Philippe Coutinho and Neymar in the dying moments of the match at the Saint Petersburg Stadium on Friday night (June 22). With a 2-0 win, Brazil stay afloat in the race to reach the last-16 of FIFA World Cup 2018, while Costa Rica bid adieu.

The win was indeed emotional for Brazil who had enjoyed the victory after last three consecutive failed attempts in World Cup history, but more so for Neymar who shrugged off his goal drought. And he answered his critics with an emotional post. After Coutinho’s tap-in from close range seconds into the injury time, Neymar drifted in the curler from Gabriel Jesus five minutes later to double the lead. It was his fifth World Cup goal in seven appearances and he also managed to surpass Brazilian legend Romario to stand third in their all-time list of goalscorers. Like Lionel Messi, pressure and hopes both rested on Neymar’s shoulders. He will remain the central figure for the fans despite them along with critics denouncing him repeatedly after each failure.

‘Not everyone knows what I went through to get here,’ he posted on Twitter and Instagram. ‘Even parrots can talk, but walking the walk... not everyone does it. I cried out of happiness, overcoming, grit and desire to win. ‘Things were never easy in my life, so why would they be now? The dream - no, the OBJECTIVE - is still alive. Congratulations for the performance, guys.’

Coach Tite warned Brazilian fans not to put too much pressure on the 26-year-old, who is playing his fourth game for Brazil after the foot injury in February.

‘The joy, the satisfaction, and the pride of representing the Brazilian national team is a lot,’ Tite told reporters. He has the responsibility, the joy, the pressure and the courage to show it. We each show it in our own way.’’He was three-and-a-half months out (with injury) and he played the full match,’ Tite added.

Nem todos sabem o q passei pra chegar até aqui,falar até papagaio fala, agora fazer...O choro é de alegria, de superação, de garra.
Na minha vida as coisas nunca foram fáceis, não seria agora né! O sonho continua, sonho não, OBJETIVO! 
Parabéns pela partida rapaziada,vcs são FODA pic.twitter.com/dgdtK2zKei

                                <h2>Do or die: Messi needs magic!</h2>
                                <p>Moscow: Lionel Messi, arguably the greatest soccer player in history, has had a miserable World Cup and must turn it around immediately to save Argentina from a humiliating early exit from the tournament.

Messi leads Argentina into a must-win Tuesday game against Nigeria at St. Petersburg Stadium, where the African team would advance out of Group D with a victory.

The South Americans are winless at the World Cup, Messi has yet to score a goal, and a victory against Nigeria won't guarantee a spot in the round of 16. Argentina must win, and get help from Croatia, which has already advanced.

Croatia has no pressure in its match against Iceland, which must win its final Group D game in Rostov-on-Don to advance. If Iceland wins, Argentina is out and Messi's international career might be over, reports the AP.

Messi turned 31 two days before the match, and there's strong speculation he'll retire from the national team if Argentina loses.

‘That will be our main goal, to make it Messi's last World Cup game,’ Nigeria defender Bryan Idowu said. ‘As much as we enjoy watching Messi play, it's against us. There's only one option for us, (which) is that he plays his last game in St. Petersburg.’

Argentina fans have been livid over the performances of the national team in this tournament, with much of the wrath directed at Messi. Although Nigeria coach Gernot Rohr is a fan of the five-time world player of the year, he has no sympathy for Messi's plight Tuesday.

‘Everybody loves him,’ Rohr said. ‘But in football there is no mercy, there is no pity. Everyone wants to win and no one can make any gifts, even if we like him so much.’
